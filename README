Croatian US keyboard for Linux

This is US keyboard layout where you get Croatian characters or
layout by pressing AltGR (right Alt) key. 
In Linux, this keyboard is known as hr-US (in X11) or crous (in console).
In short, Coders like it. 

crous.map is console map 
the rest is for X11 or Xorg. If you have decent Xorg release, layout is already
included - you don't have to install anything - you can just set it by:

setxkbmap hr us

or by setting up in xorg.conf:

Option "XkbLayout" "hr(us)"

It is collection of different keyboard definitions from different authors.
